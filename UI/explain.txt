The facade class is designed to be extended to create facades around the widget and layout treeNode implementations.
The intention is to keep low level optimisations available to the user of the UI library while still providing a 
simple API. Using facades is ever so slightly slower at runtime but will allow for much faster development

facade API uses the builder pattern for readability and conciseness

Benefits of effective facades:
-programmer doesn't have to worry about ownership eg manageing unique pointers
