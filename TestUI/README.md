# UI Library

## This library is a work in progress!!! 

### This is a UI library written on top of the SFML 2D graphics library.
SFML is used only for rendering triangles and text,
but handling vertex arrays etc. is done by the UI library itself,
so it can be ported to OpenGL or Vulkan in the future.
